Zig does A LOT of spoofing in this directory!  There are README's in the directories explaining their purposes'  Feel free to take a look around! :)

## In this directory

1. [zig](zig) - invokes the zig cli and forwards the cli args to it.
2. [zig-env.sh](zig-env.sh) - returns environment variables to configure zig.
3. [zig-install.sh](zig-install.sh) - installs zig to the [../gitignore/zig](../gitignore/zig) folder.  This folder is also where the zig cache will default to.
