These are the executables that godot-nir is looking for when it builds the dx12 and mesa code.  Now the strange thing to notice here is that [x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc](x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc) is actually calling zig c++.  For whatever reason, godot-nir tries to send cpp files to the gcc compiler instead of the g++ compiler.  Not sure who is at fault here but something fishy is going on.  Thanfully zig saves the day with zig c++! :)
